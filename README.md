# Drive 2 Destiny Backend Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Drive 2 Destiny repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nightcoder26/SWE-LAB.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**: Move into the backend directory of the project:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm (Node Package Manager) to install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Server

4. **Start the Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server:

    ```bash
    nodemon app.js
    ```

5. **Access the Backend**: The server should now be running locally on port 3000 by default. You can open http://localhost:3000
   You can access the backend API endpoints using tools like Postman or by making HTTP requests.
